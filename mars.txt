Cold and dry, but everything is my favourite colour.

I hereby concur, that alarm that goes every 5 minutes - is rather annoying....

1. devise a plan prevent the bad bad bad person from their alarm.

2. carry out justice
Burn him alive!!! ALIVE!!! not bury alive? O. o

KILL HIM KILL HIM KILL HIM

3. be happy
